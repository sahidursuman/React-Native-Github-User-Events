# React-Native-Playground
My progression with React Native on Android/iOS

My current tools include:
+ **Android Studio** for Android specific code
+ **Xcode** for iOS specific code
+ **Visual Studio Code** for JavaScript/JSX (I compared VS Code to Nuclide and Webstorm, VS Code wins)
+ **Iterm2** terminal
+ **Source Tree** for viewing diffs quickly, Staging hunks, quick commits
